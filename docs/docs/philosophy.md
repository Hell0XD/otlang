# Philosophy


Even tho the language can sound to a unexperienced programmer as simple and just modern programming language without some stuff that's not true, the language uses many modern features and code in it will be much shorter and readeble than in languages like **C#** and **PHP**.

**OT** is not perfect language, but a proof of concept what language can actually do without much work and to train different thinking methods.

The main idea about the language is that
*"A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing."* - **Alan J. Perlis** and that's why the language was created.
