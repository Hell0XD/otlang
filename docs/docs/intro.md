# Getting started with OT

**OT** is programming language from **LISP** family, therefore the syntax is composed of s-expressions like this `(+ 6 4 5)`. The language is dynamicaly typed and compiled into bytecode that is than executed using an **VM**.    


## Hello world

Create an main file and put the code below into it.

```
    mod main

    (print "hello world\n")
```

After that run **otc** to compile the file using `otc` and `otvm .out` to run the generated bytecode.

The output in the console should be `hello world`.
